# ðŸ§  Intelligent Resume Screener

A smart, NLP-powered Streamlit web app that analyzes a candidate's resume against a given job description and returns a match score based on semantic similarity.

This tool helps job seekers and recruiters quickly assess how well a resume aligns with a specific job role.

âœ¨ Example Use Case
You're applying to a job and want to check how well your resume matches the JD.
Just upload both files â€” the app gives you a similarity score and flags missing keywords to help you improve it.

## ðŸš€ Features

- Upload a **PDF resume** and **job description**
- Extracts and preprocesses text using **spaCy**
- Computes **semantic similarity** using **TF-IDF** and **cosine similarity**
- Returns a **Match Score (%)**
- Highlights feedback for low match cases
- Clean and intuitive **Streamlit UI**

ðŸ§  How It Works
PDF Parsing: Uses PyPDF2 to extract text from uploaded resume and JD files.

Text Preprocessing: Cleans and lemmatizes text using spaCy.

Vectorization: Applies TfidfVectorizer to convert text to vectors.

Similarity Scoring: Uses cosine_similarity to compare resume and JD content.

Result Display: Shows score, feedback, and optional warning or balloon animation.
